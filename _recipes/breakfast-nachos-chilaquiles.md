After a disappointing restaurant breakfast of flabby breakfast chilaquiles, we decided to make our own.

So we look up [chilaquiles recipes](https://www.google.ca/search?q=chilaquiles). First off, chilaquiles are a lie. These are breakfast nachos. The establishment is afraid that breakfast nachos will take off, so they renamed them to chilaquiles. And every one of the chilaquiles recipes you'll find (which are all different) actually spend 30 minutes making salsa.

OK, so you do need to start by making "salsa" -- aka some tomatoes and spices and such.

Put some olive oil or magical bacon grease in a large oven proof pan and add the onions, tomatoes, garlic, and spices. Include a couple of tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro at this point. We snuck in some chopped chorizo at this point as well. Saute the mixture over low heat until it all sort of melts together. Salt and pepper to taste. You're going to mix in some eggs, so make it salty and peppery.

Meanwhile, take your fresh corn tortillas and quarter them if they're small, or cut them into 2 inch square strips if they are large. Fry them in another pan in hot vegetable oil until they are crisp - a light brown colour. Let them drip on some paper towels.

Back to our salsa. Mix together the eight eggs, increase the heat on the salsa, and pour the eggs in. Mix the eggs and salsa together, moving the mixture around the pan as the eggs cook from the bottom, You're done when the mixture is mainly holding together but still moist.

Set aside four fried tortilla chips for each plate, and gently mix the rest of them into the egg salsa mixture. Sprinkle with the rest of the cilantro. Sprinkle with grated cheese. We added some pickled hot chillies at this point, you might try cooked bacon or sausage or other things that don't need cooking but crisp up nice under a broiler

Put in the oven on broil until the cheese is nice and molten or even starting to brown a little.

Plate directly onto the crunchy tortilla chips you left on each plate. Add some sour cream and your favourite hot sauce. Have some breakfast meats on the side.

LONG LIVE BREAKFAST NACHOS!!!
