Every Christmas, I buy a Cook's Illustrated for holiday reading. This is one of the recipes that caught my eye.

There are alternate versions with Capers & Pine Nuts, and Cumin & Pistachios.

We love roasted cauliflower, and have tried to recreate the Najib's Special from Vancouver restaurant [Nuba](http://nuba.ca) many times. They deep fry it, and at home various ways of roasting end up either too oily or too dry.

(I note that someone else posted their version of Najib's as [lemon, cumin, and sumac roasted cauliflower](http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2011/01/lemon-roasted-cauliflower-with-cumin-sumac/) back in 2011)
