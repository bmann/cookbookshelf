Cauliflower has been much in the news in Vancouver for being very expensive. Rachael came home with a very large head of cauliflower that was very reasonable in price, and I was excited to try another whole spice experiment from Jaffrey's book.

Unfortunately, I thought we had yellow mustard seeds, but didn't. Then I decided that substituting a mix of fenugreek and coriander might be a sort of similar interesting flavour direction.

I was incorrect.

I was happy with the cooking method generally. I made it in a wok, and used a mix of coconut oil and canola oil, but didn't quite use 7 Tbsp. The garlic was nice and fragment, and the little bit of turmeric coloured the cauliflower nicely. The cauliflower was fairly crisp and a little toasted, and I drained it on paper towel and it wasn't too oily.

I added a little bit of fresh squeezed lemon while serving it, and it brightened it up nicely.

Either the fenugreek or the coriander (or both) took things in a weird direction. If (when!) I do it again, just the fennel seed would be nice, and I could even just add some dry mustard power.
