I made this biscuit recipe for the second time tonight (again as an accompaniment to tomato soup). I need to remember to not roll them out so thin, because they actually steam from the inside and puff up nicely when thicker.

It says shortening, but I've used everything from butter to coconut oil. The coconut oil I last used did actually make the biscuits taste a bit of coconut, which was nice.
