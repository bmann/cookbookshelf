<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> made this biscuit recipe for the second time tonight (again as an accompaniment to tomato soup). I need to remember to not roll them out so thin, because they actually steam from the inside and puff up nicely when thicker.</p>

It says shortening, but I've used everything from butter to coconut oil.
