I went off recipe a lot.

Canned chickpea rather than dry.

Whole fennel seeds rather than cumin (but still put ground cumin in) and finely chopped garlic + ginger rather than a paste. No cardamon. Whole coriander rather than ground.

I decided to cube the pork chops rather than doing them whole. I cooked the whole thing in a cast iron Dutch oven, first on the stove top, then in the oven at 425 for the final simmering.

Could have had a bit more spice heat to it, but it was tasty & flavourful.
