We are slowly adding to our tradition of custom pans/implements for making batter-based yums. German Eierpfannkuchen, [Trinidadian Roti](/cookbookshelf/recipe/rachaels-roti/), and [Danish Ebelskiver](/cookbookshelf/recipe/ebelskivers-danish-pancakes/) are joined by Japanese Taiyaki, aka "fish waffle"

Rachael got her taiyaki pan from Amazon (thanks, Kathy!). We found packaged red bean paste at [Fujiya](http://www.fujiya.ca), the Japanese grocery story just a short walk from our house. We waited until evening when it was a little cooler, and then did a test run of making some taiyaki with red bean filling.
