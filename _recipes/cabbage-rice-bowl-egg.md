I make this fairly often as a healthy, quick, all-in-one meal option. I think of this as an "Asian" dish because I finish it with a mix of Asian condiments. Rachael likes to use Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, and I blend together Filipino Sugarcane Vinegar, Soy Sauce, and Chili Garlic Sauce.

You can put whatever vegetables you like in there -- the crunch of raw vegetables, many of them grated, goes well with the rice, your condiments of choice, and the loveliness of a soft egg yolk coating everything.
