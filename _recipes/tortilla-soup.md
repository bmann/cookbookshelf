I freestyled this Mexican-style tortilla soup with some home made chicken stock.

I used bones / backs I bought at the store with the skin on to make the stock, and made it in the slow cooker overnight. This meant that in the morning I was able to skim off about 1/2 a cup of pure chicken fat.

Saute all the vegetables in a little olive oil (or chicken fat!) over high heat until onions begin to brown. Add in chicken stock and canned tomatoes, and add ground cumin and chili powder.

Turn down heat to simmer until carrots are tender. Adjust salt to taste.

Squeeze in juice from the fresh lime. Add in fresh chopped cilantro and cook 5 minutes more. Toast one small / half large tortilla per person and cut into strips and put in the bottom of each soup bowl and ladle the soup on top.

Can be served with (Canadian) cheese curds or Mexican queso blanco grated over the soup.
