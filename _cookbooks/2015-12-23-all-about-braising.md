I wasn't able to find a whole duck to buy for our Christmas Eve 2015 dinner, so instead bought duck legs.

I ended up stretching the braise mixture with celeriac and shiitake mushrooms, and also substituting sherry instead of port. It was good, but the flavour got blasted out by the cherries, especially since I did end up with sweetened dried cherries.
