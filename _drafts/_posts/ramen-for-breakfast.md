We were over in Victoria for the weekend, visiting Darren & Kirsti at their new house. 

On Saturday night we picked up a pre-made Duck Ramen Broth from The Village Butcher, plus a Smoked Duck Breast from the next door Whole Beast deli. 

Bok choy and bean sprouts completed the ramen base. Then w<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">e were lucky enough to find that I Kyu Noodles in Chinatown sell fresh ramen noodles.</span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">The broth was good, but actually needed some sakt and other finishing. I put in some sesame oil, salt, and a bit of rice wine vinegar. We added more seasonings to our individual bowls - regular or mushroom soy sauce, crushed chiles, or a bit more salt.</span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Here's the finished bowl:</span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Also, I found out when making the ramen noodles two things. One, that they're sold in a bag that contains 6 "balls" of noodles, and two, 8 noodle servings for 4 people is way too much. </span>
