We are slowly adding to our tradition of custom pans/implements for making batter-based yums. German Eierpfannkuchen, Trinidadian Roti, and Danish Ebelskiver are joined by Japanese Taiyaki, aka "fish waffle"

Rachael got her taiyaki pan from Amazon (thanks, Kathy!). We found packaged red bean paste at [Fujiya](http://www.fujiya.ca), the Japanese grocery story just a short walk from our house. We waited until evening when it was a little cooler, and then did a test run of making some taiyaki with red bean paste.
